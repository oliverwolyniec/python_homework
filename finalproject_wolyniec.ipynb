    "This summer, I spent six weeks in the South Caucasus conducting research on civil society-led peacebuilding initiatives in Armenia, in the particular context of the decades-long Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. I was based in Yerevan, Armenia's capital, but also spent several days in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. Throughout my time there, I was perpetually struck by the hateful rhetoric used by both political leaders and regular people on both sides of the conflict. At times it was downright appalling - I recall watching a recent video of an elderly Azerbaijani woman, in the aftermath of an Armenian strike, crying, \"We thirst for every last drop of Armenian blood. We thirst for their children's blood.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Such hateful speech has become an integral dimension of the conflict, especially as actual contact between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, which has in many cases facilitated mutual understanding, increasingly vanishes. I was struck when an Armenian colleague at the Yerevan think tank I worked with over the summer told me that she'd only met one Azerbaijani in her life, when she lived in Russia in her youth. She added that if she had an opportunity in the future to speak with someone from Azerbaijan, she wouldn't take it. This was coming from somebody I deeply admired for her intellectual curiosity and openmindedness, and someone who had been involved to varying degrees in peacebuilding efforts before. If someone with her position and pedigree was completely uninterested in building bridges, what hope was there to promote reconciliation - especially when travel by Armenians to Azerbaijan, and even their presence in the other country, and vice versa has effectively been banned? My colleague never used bombastic, hateful speech, but there was always a sense of disdain, and that Armenians had been deeply, indelibly wronged by the Azerbaijanis.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can, though, often hear hateful, dehumanizing rhetoric emanating from the top offices in both countries. In my experience, Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan since 2003, is the bigger culprit, but Armenia's Nikol Pashinyan, prime minister since 2018, is guilty of weaponizing such speech as well. I'm interested in investigating how Aliyev and Pashinyan use hate narratives, when and to what end they use them, and their historical roots, among other things. Borrowing from Iwona Jakubowska-Branicka (2016), hate narratives are patterns of speech or communication that promote hostility, discrimination, or violence against a particular group, often based on their ethnicity, religion, nationality, gender, or other traits. Hate narratives often involve stereotyping, dehumanization, or the justification of harm toward the targeted group. **My primary research question is as follows: How do the speeches of Nikol Pashinyan and Ilham Aliyev between 2020 and 2024 reflect and propagate hate narratives, and what differences or similarities exist in their rhetorical strategies?**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the conflict began in 1988 as the Soviet Union began to crumble, my focus is on the past four years, and especially on four particularly pivotal events: the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, which lasted from late September to early November 2020; September 2022 clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan which included the largest attacks by Azerbaijan on Armenia proper in the history of the conflict; the Azerbaijani blockade of the Lachin corridor, the only road connecting Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, which began in December 2022; and the one-day lightning offensive launched by Azerbaijan in September 2023, giving it complete control of Nagorno-Karabakh for the first time and leading to the exodus of nearly all Armenians from the territory and into mainland Armenia.\n",
    "\n",
    "My analysis includes speeches by Pashinyan and Aliyev before, during, and after these events. In total, it includes 48 speeches by Pashinyan and 36 by Aliyev, scraped from their official websites. All the speeches are available in English on the sites. More precisely, it includes 16 Pashinyan speeches and 11 Aliyev speeches around the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War; six Pashinyan and eight Aliyev speeches around the September 2022 clashes; 12 Pashinyan and seven Aliyev speeches around the Lachin corridor blockade; and 14 Pashinyan and 10 Aliyev speeches around the 2023 lightning offensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it's always helpful to get a mental picture of where something is taking place, so let's generate a map."

    "Firstly, it looks like the average sentiment for Aliyev's speeches over this time period is slightly higher than that of Pashinyan's speeches, which makes sense. Azerbaijan was the clear victor across these stages of the conflict, winning on the battlefield over nearly all the events and eventually taking over Nagorno-Karabakh completely. It's interesting that Pashinyan's mean sentiment is in the positive range, considering Armenia, obviously, was the clear loser and lost control of what it sees as some of its historical homeland. Much of this can be chalked up to Pashinyan's opting to strike a tone of resilience and optimism in many of his speeches. For example, this excerpt from his Nov. 12, 2020 speech, just after the end of the 2nd NK War, illustrates this point: \"Many may whether we can talk about a good future after such a disastrous war. Yes, because today there are countries that have suffered the most severe capitulations in the 20th century, but today are among the most powerful nations in the world. They did so after a brutal defeat, with an emphasis on the development of education, science, industry and democracy, and this should be our next step. And I urge all of us to focus on what we can do to strengthen our country. This will be our best service to the memory of our martyrs, our wounded and disabled servicemen, their relatives, families, mothers, fathers, wives, and children.\" Clearly, Pashinyan here is trying to maintain a sense of hope and looking forward to a brighter future."

    "A couple of things jump out to me from the line graph. Pashinyan's most positive speech came right after the start of the 2nd NK War. Here's a bit of it: \"Victory and only victory is the ending that we see at the end of this struggle. Today, a few hours ago, the Artsakh Defense Army launched a powerful counteroffensive and recorded significant advances and destroyed several special units of Azerbaijan. No matter how many mercenaries have been deployed over there: the Azerbaijani side cannot compete with the Armenian will to win and live. With joint efforts we will break the adversary's backbone, so that it could never raise its murderous hands on us, so that its bloody gaze could never fall upon our people...This is a new Sardarapat, and we all should be prepared to devote ourselves to a single mission that we call final victory. Each of us must be ready to be on the forefront of that victory. We will win! We are sure to win! Rest assured that victory will be on our side!\" At this point in the war, there were indeed a few positive developments for the Armenian side, but more than anything this speech serves as a rallying cry, a way for Pashinyan to inject a sense of purpose and victory into his people. It was looking like it might become a protracted conflict at this point, so Pashinyan was trying to motivate and inspire the Armenian forces and people, and ready them for a potentially long war. After this point, things went clearly south for Armenia on the battlefield, and you can see that reflected in the sentiment of Pashinyan's ensuing speeches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not surprisingly, Aliyev's speeches were clearly more positive than Pashinyan's after the conclusion of the 2nd NK War. Azerbaijan won and claimed quite a bit of territory. We then see Aliyev at his most positive after the September 2022 border clashes, which tracks - the Azerbaijani attacks struck across a wide swath of Armenia proper, the largest such offensive on mainland Armenia in the entire history of the conflict. Armenia put up little resistance, and the international community hardly batted an eye, so Aliyev had to be feeling pretty good: \"Our Victory march started in this direction as we broke through the enemy's first line of defense. For 44 days, the Azerbaijan Army moved forward every single day. Every day, without stopping, without pausing, tirelessly, we went forward, shedding blood and giving martyrs, but advancing towards Victory. We didn't stop even for a day. We didn't step back even for a day but went forward, chasing the enemy on the battlefield and winning the historic Victory.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we can see that Pashinyan was at his most negative in the lead up to Azerbaijan's 2023 lightning offensive and takeover of NK. You can clearly feel a sense of despair in this Sep. 7, 2023 speech as Azerbaijan built up its forces at the front lines: \"In the past week, the military-political situation in our region significantly worsened. The reason is that Azerbaijan has been accumulating troops for days along the Nagorno Karabakh contact line and the Armenia-Azerbaijan border. The rhetoric of anti-Armenian hatred has intensified in the Azerbaijani press and propaganda platforms. The policy of encroachment on the sovereign territory of Armenia continues.\" Interestingly, Pashinyan's rhetoric grows slightly more positive after the Azerbaijani offensive, again most probably to strike that tone of resilience and optimism, looking forward to (hopefully) less bleak times."
