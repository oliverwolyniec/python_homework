      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Thank you for taking time on \n",
      "your holiday.  The purpose of this meeting is to update the Committee on financial developments \n",
      "over the weekend and to consider whether we want to take a policy action today.  I would like to start with a brief update on the markets from Bill Dudley  and take any questions for him, and \n",
      "then I will introduce the issue, make a recommendation, and ask for your comments following that.  Bill, would you like to give us a short review? \n",

      "MR. DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our videoconference on \n",
      "January 9, the market functioning in terms of the bank term funding markets has \n",
      "generally continued to improve , with  the one-month and three-month LIBOR  relative \n",
      "to the overnight index swap  rates coming back very sharply.  They are now as narrow \n",
      "as they’ve been since the market turmoil began.   But elsewhere in terms of market \n",
      "functioning , we started to see a step backward last week —especially late in the \n",
      "week —when we viewed the asset -backed  commercial paper market beginning to \n",
      "deteriorate again , and there was s ome flight to quality into the Treasury bill market \n",
      "late last week.  \n",
      "  More important, the macro outlook and  broader financial market conditions \n",
      "have continued to deteriorate quite sharply.  The S&P 500 index, for example, fell 5.4 percent last week ; it is  down almost 10 percent so far this year.  Today it fell \n",
      "another 60 points, or 4.5 percent, so that means that the cumulative decline in the S&P 500, if it opens near where the futures markets closed to day, will be nearly \n",
      "15 percent since the start of the y ear.  Global stock markets were also down very \n",
      "sharply today—Mo nday.  Depending on where you look, the range of decline was \n",
      "anywhere from 3 percent to 7 ½ percent , pretty much across the board.  Corporate \n",
      "credit spreads and credit default spreads have continued to widen, and bank mark- to-\n",
      "market losses and loan -loss provisions keep increasing.  The Merrill Lynch and \n",
      "Citigroup earnings  announcements last week generally suggested a widening in terms \n",
      "of the scope of losses, not just in subprime but also in terms of credit card receivables and other loans. \n",
      "   A newish wrinkle here in terms of bank markdowns reflects the deterioration of \n",
      "some of the monoline guarantors.  Merrill Lynch, for example, announced a multibillion dollar char ge for its exposure to AC A, whi ch is the most impaired of the \n",
      "monoline guarantors.  The other monoline guarantors are in better shape, but they’ve either been downgraded , such as the case of  Ambac by Fitch  on Friday afternoon, or \n",
      "are under review for being downgraded by a number of diff erent credit -rating \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "3 of 32agencies.  The problem with the monoline guarantors is that raising  capital  has \n",
      "become much more difficult.  Ten days ago, for example, MBIA issued 14 percent \n",
      "surplus notes, which are now trading at about 70 cents on the dollar.  It’s n ot clear \n",
      "how much additional capital is needed to keep the AAA rating.  The go al posts keep \n",
      "moving.  S&P, for example, raised its loss estimates  on subprime mortgages about a \n",
      "week and a half ago , and this has implications for the monoline insurers in terms  of \n",
      "their capital adequacy.   \n",
      " So the bottom line is that, unless the monoline insurers raise significant additional \n",
      "capital soon, further rating downgrade s seem  very, very likely.  T his has three \n",
      "potential consequences that are noteworthy.  First, in the money market space, a \n",
      "number of money market products are w rapped by the monoline guarantors, including \n",
      "variable- rate demand notes, auction -rate securities, and tender option bonds.  Some of \n",
      "these securities have liquidity support, so if the securities can’t be rolled over , they’ll \n",
      "go to the banks, and this will increase the pressure on bank balance sheets.  For t hose \n",
      "without liquidity support , either they will be converted to longer- dated securities , \n",
      "which the investors will be surprised to find out they are holding, or th e dealers will \n",
      "have to take them back on their books to prevent the auctions from failing.  A second \n",
      "consequence from monoline guarant or downgrades would be to the municipal bond \n",
      "funds.  The loss of AAA insurance raises  the question of what the retail bond \n",
      "investors do.  Do they start pulling out their money and run?  So far things are pretty calm on that front.  For example, last week the net asset values of some of the major muni bond insurance funds actually increased a bit for the week.   So there are no \n",
      "signs of a run there yet, but we haven’t really explored this fully , given the fact that \n",
      "only one major monoline guarantor has been downgraded and that happened late, late last week.  Third, financial institutions have to mark down the va lue of the \n",
      "guarantors’ insurance as their financial conditions worsen.  In contrast, the monoline s \n",
      "don’t have to mark to market.  D owngrad ing the monolines frontloads the hit to \n",
      "capital and potentially aggravates the magnitude of the hit to capital because  market \n",
      "valuations can  overshoot.  So it is not trivial to transfer this  risk from the monoline s \n",
      "to the financial institutions given the distinction that  the monoline s do not have to  \n",
      "mark to market but financial institutions that use their insurance do. \n",
      " At this point, monetary policy expectations  have priced in  a lot of easing over the \n",
      "near term.  As of Friday’s close, there w ere about 67 basis points priced in through \n",
      "the January meeting at the end of the month and  about 110 basis points priced in \n",
      "through the March meeting (if you look at the April federal funds futures contract ).  \n",
      "There is likely  more than that now given the decline in the equity futures market that \n",
      "we saw today.  So the markets are expecting quite a bit from the Fed.  I’ll be happy to take any questions, of course. \n",
      " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there questions for Bill?  President Lacker?  \n",
      "MR. LACKER.  Can you explain that third consequence of monoline downgrades?  I \n",
      "didn’t quite get that.  \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "4 of 32MR. DUDLEY.  The monoline insurers don’t have to mark to market the consequences \n",
      "of the deterioration in, say, the structured -finance product they insured.  All they have to do is \n",
      "pay out, as it is incurred, the interest that the structured -finance product can’t pay out.  So their \n",
      "losses are going to be realized only very gradually over a long period of time.  There is no sort of \n",
      "foreshortening of all  that into the present.  In contrast, if a monoline guarantor gets downgraded \n",
      "and so the financial institution no longer has the support of that monoline guarantee, they have to write down instantaneously the value of the assets that were wrapped by that guarantee.  So it’s quite a big difference in terms of the market impact as you transfer that risk from the monoline guarantors to the financial institutions that b ought that insurance. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Bill?  President  Hoenig. \n",
      "MR. HOENIG.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  I don’t want to get ahead of what you might be \n",
      "saying, but if Bill could give us a sense of what the markets are doing overseas, I would appreciate just his sense of things. \n",
      "MR. DUDLEY.  Well, the market on Monday morning in Asia was down somewhere \n",
      "around 3, 4, or 5 percent, and it was everywhere, including some of the emerging markets that up to now had performed pretty well.  India took one of its biggest one-day hits, for example, in a very long time.  Then, we got to Europe, and the declines in Europe were actually a little bigger than the declines that we saw in Asia.  For example, the Dow Jones S TOXX 50 Index, which is \n",
      "an index of 50 large European companies, was down 7¼ percent on Monday.  The market went down sharply at the open, it rallied back up a bit during the day, and then it c ame sharply down \n",
      "again at the close.  So for both indexes you are basically at or very close to the low for the day.   \n",
      "Bond markets reacted as you might expect.  Bond markets rallied as people became more pessimistic about the stock market.  In the currency market, we saw the sort of normal risk -\n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "5 of 32aversion behavior.  The e uro underperformed, the dollar was in the middle, and the yen \n",
      "appreciated as people were reducing their risk appetites.    \n",
      "I talked to some people about what was going on in Europe.  I didn’t really feel as though \n",
      "my contacts there were focused exclusively on the financial guarantor s.  That  was part of the \n",
      "story, but there were other parts of the story, including the idea that maybe decoupling isn’t \n",
      "going to happen to the degree that we hoped.  Also, part of the story was that the risks of recession in the U nited States  were increasing.  S o financial guarantors got  part of the blame for \n",
      "the stock market decline in Asia and Europe, but that by no means was the whole story. \n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions?  If not, let me just talk about the issue \n",
      "here.  I was reluctant to call this meeting, b oth because of the holiday and because the \n",
      "Committee did express a preference on January 9 for not moving between regularly scheduled  \n",
      "meetings and I accepted that judgment on January 9.  However, I think there are times when events are just moving too fast for us to wait for the regular meeting.  I know it is only a week away, but seven trading days is a long time in financial markets.  As Bill described, over the holiday, global stock markets have been falling very sharply, both in Asia and in Europe.  As he mentioned, even though the U.S. markets are closed, the S&P 500 was off about 60 points today, close to 5 percent.  That makes the cumulative decline in the S&P 500 since our last FOMC meeting 16 ½ percent.   Obviously, it is not our job to target stock values or to protect stock \n",
      "investors, but I think that this is a symptom of both sharply mounting concerns about the economy and increasing problems in credit markets.  \n",
      "On the economy, the data and the information that we can glean from financial markets \n",
      "reflect a growing belief that the United States  is in for a deep and protracted recession.  \n",
      "Moreover, as we saw from the global markets today, the concern is rising that that recession will \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "6 of 32have global consequences.  Consequently, we saw, for example, an 8 percent drop today in the \n",
      "German stock market.  The dollar rose today, reflecting I think increasing belief that other central banks will have to follow us in cutting rates, and oil prices are down to about $87, reflecting expectations of slowing global dema nd.  So it is not necessarily a U.S.-only story. \n",
      "On the financial side, as Bill noted, a lot of things are going on.  The latest is the likely \n",
      "downgrade of one or more of the monoline insurers, which would cause banks and other financial institutions to ha ve to mark down billions more of their holdings.  I think there is a \n",
      "general sense— I certainly feel in talking to market participants —that it is not just subprime \n",
      "anymore  and that there are real concerns about other kinds of consumer credit—c redit cards, \n",
      "autos, and  home equity loans—and that there is fear of housing prices falling enough that \n",
      "contagion will infect prime mortgage loans.  There is building in the market a real dynamic of withdrawal from risk, withdrawal from normal credit extension, which I think is very worrisome. \n",
      "Would a rate action today, before the start of trading tomorrow, be of help?  I don’t \n",
      "know.  I n some sense it was a lucky break that toda y was a holiday because in the middle of the \n",
      "day we got a very good read on what the markets are doing tomorrow, and so we can get ahead of things as opposed to being forced, after a couple of disastrous days, to respond.  Again, I don’t know if this would help, but I think that indicating that the Fed is on top of the situation and  that \n",
      "we are prop osing to address economic and credit risks aggressively would help.  In any case, it \n",
      "would at least make clear that the Fed was in touch with the situation.  \n",
      "I think we have to t ake a meaningful action —something that will have an important \n",
      "effect.  T herefor e, I am proposing a cut of 75 basis points.  I recognize that this is a very large \n",
      "change.  I would not do that if I thought that the size of the cut was inconsistent with our medium- term macroeconomic objectives.  Let me discuss that a few minutes.  \n",
      "January 21, 2008\n",
      "7 of 32As I said to some of you, on Friday I had a briefing from Dave Stockton and his team \n",
      "about their Greenbook forecast for next week’s meeting.  They have not made an explicit \n",
      "recession call, but they do forecast very weak growth going forward.  More important, in order to get that positive economic growth, they revised down their assumed path of the federal funds rate by 100 basis points—50 basis points next week and 50 basis points in March.  That gives a cumulative de cline in the staff’s  fed funds assumption of 200 basis points since August, which is \n",
      "consistent both with the markets and with a 225 basis point decline in medium- term r*, which is \n",
      "an indicator of the neutral rate, as well as the optimal policy rate that they calculate.   Importantly, \n",
      "of course, we hav e lowered the funds rate only 100 basis points so far, so I think at first \n",
      "approximation we are about 100 basis points behind the curve—something in that general area —\n",
      "in terms of the neutral rate, and that itself doesn’t even take into account what I belie ve at this \n",
      "point is a legitimate need for risk management.    \n",
      "With respect to risk management, these credit risks obviously have the potential to feed \n",
      "back in to our financial system and to affect the economy going forward.  I hope to be able to talk \n",
      "next week more about a simulation the staff is working on, which shows that a severe recession would create extraordinary credit losses for our financial institutions, with implications obviously for credit extension and for financial stability.  It is just one indicator, but a paper by \n",
      "Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff has been circulated in the past couple of days, which compares some indicators of our economy with  other major financial crises and finds that we rank at the \n",
      "moment among the five largest financial cr ises in any industrial country since World War II.  \n",
      "Given what their indicators show, they conclude that, if we have only a mild recession in the United States , it would be a very fortunate outcome.  Now, I am not saying that this is \n",
      "necessarily  evidence, but I am saying that there are risks and that a careful approach should \n",

      "being more aggressive initially, trying to address the problem, and then removing accommodation as the situation calms down.  I think there is a case for doing that, given the fact that we have done 100 basis points and that we seem to have not reall y made a dent.  \n",
      "Now, of course, there is also the issue of inflation.  Many of you have valid concerns \n",
      "about inflation.  Let me just make a few comments on that.  First, in the Greenbook, despite a 100 basis point drop in the rate assumption and the scenario that  I take as being in some sense \n",
      "optimistic in that it avoids an outright recession, the preliminary Greenbook forecast for 2009 has total PCE inflation at 1.7 percent and core PCE inflation at 1.9 percent .  This does not take \n",
      "into account any disinfla tionary effects that would arise if we did have an NB ER recession or \n",
      "worse.  Again, I note that we have, for example, effects working through oil prices, which the Greenbook doesn’t take into account directly.  So I think, obviously, that  we have to continue to \n",
      "watch inflation and inflation expectations carefully.  It is very important to do so.  But at this point we are facing , potentially , a broad -based crisis.  We can no longer temporize.  We have to \n",
      "address this crisis.  We have to try to  get it under control.  If we can’t do that, then we are just \n",
      "going to lose control of the whole situation. \n",
      "So that is my case.  I think we really have no choice but to try to get ahead of this.  A \n",

    "The global financial crisis (GFC) refers to the period of extreme stress in global financial markets and banking systems between mid 2007 and early 2009. During the GFC, a downturn in the US housing market was a catalyst for a financial crisis that spread from the United States to the rest of the world through linkages in the global financial system. Many banks around the world incurred large losses and relied on government support to avoid bankruptcy. Millions of people lost their jobs as the major advanced economies experienced their deepest recessions since the Great Depression in the 1930s.\n",

      "Paragraph 1: Conference Call of the Federal Open Market Committee on September 29, 2008 A conference call of the Federal Open Market Committee was held on Monday, September 29, 2008, at 9:00 a.m. Those present were the following: Mr. Bernanke, Chairman Mr. Geithner, Vice Chairman Ms. Duke Mr. Fisher Mr. Kohn Mr. Kroszner Ms. Pianalto Mr. Plosser Mr. Stern Mr. Warsh Messrs. Evans, Lacker, and Lockhart, and Ms. Yellen, Alternate Members of the Federal Open Market Committee Messrs.

Fuhrer and Judd, Executive Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and San Francisco, respectively Ms. George, Messrs. Sellon, Sullivan, and Weinberg, Senior Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City, Kansas City, Chicago, and Richmond, respectively Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Conference Call on September 29, 2008 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Thank you as always for your flexibility and meeting on short notice—particularly to Janet. How are you feeling today, Janet?\n",
      "Paragraph 2: MS. YELLEN. Fine, thank you.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I have three topics to raise with you today. First, financial market conditions, as you know, remain quite strained, and in response to that we are proposing some additional liquidity measures. Mostly this is informational. However, we are proposing to increase the swap lines fairly significantly, and although you have authorized the Foreign Currency Subcommittee to take those actions, we thought that, given the size of the change, it would be worthwhile to bring this back to you for your attention and your vote just to get the Committee’s agreement on this issue. The second issue is Wachovia. As you may have heard, Wachovia was purchased, or there’s a plan to purchase, by Citigroup this morning. To facilitate that purchase, the Board invoked the systemic risk exception, which has not been done before. So we want to give you a chance to catch up on what’s going on there. Then third, we want to talk a bit about interest on reserves, which will be provided in the Paulson financial rescue bill, which is supposed to be up for a vote on Wednesday. I just want to brief you on what we’re planning in that regard. So let me start by turning to Bill Dudley in New York. Bill, if you could give us a brief overview of the financial conditions that motivate these actions, review the actions we’re proposing, and take Q&A, that would be very helpful.\n",
      "Paragraph 4: MR. DUDLEY. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me start with the foreign exchange swap lines, and then I’ll talk a bit about the TAF increases and about the balance sheet. I think Brian later is going to talk about interest on reserves in more detail.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: All of the foreign central banks that have obtained dollar swap lines in response to dollar funding pressures in their home markets have decided, with some encouragement on our part, to seek an increase in the size of these swap line authorizations. We just have to hear from the Bank of Japan—I think that’s the only one that’s outstanding—but we expect to hear that shortly. The actual draws on these lines may turn out to be considerably less, and the amounts that are actually drawn are likely to depend on market conditions. The large increase in authorization should be considered as insurance in case market conditions continue to deteriorate and as reassurance to market participants that the world’s major central banks are determined to respond in force to mitigate dollar funding pressures. By foreign central banks, the current lines are being doubled for the larger participants and tripled for the smaller participants. The increases are as follows, very quickly: the Bank of Canada, $30 billion from $10 billion; the Bank of England, $80 billion from $40 billion; the Bank of Japan, $120 billion from $60 billion; the National Bank of Denmark, $15 billion from $5 billion; the ECB, $240 billion from $120 billion; the Bank of Norway, $15 billion from $5 billion; the Reserve Bank of Australia, $30 billion from $10 billion; the Swedish Riksbank, $30 billion from $10 billion; and the Swiss National Bank, $60 billion from $30 billion.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: Adding up all of this would result in an increase in our swap line authorization to $620 billion from $290 billion previously. I think that these decisions have been made in response to the increasing turmoil evident in interbank markets, especially for dollar funding; and by increasing the size of the authorization significantly, the intention is to reassure market participants that sufficient dollar funding will be available well into 2009.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: The staff believes that these large increases are appropriate to reassure market participants that the world’s central banks are prepared to take extraordinary steps as needed to address ongoing strains in financial markets. These strains are evident in a number of ways. First, we’ve seen a sharp rise in overnight dollar funding rates and in term LIBOR–OIS spreads. For example, on Friday, the three-month LIBOR–OIS spread was over 200 basis points, and in fact, LIBOR may actually understate the degree of funding pressure. The NYFR index, which is the U.S.-based alternative to LIBOR, has actually been much higher than LIBOR over the past week or two. So LIBOR actually may be understated. Second, there have been many anecdotal reports of a withdrawal of counterparties’ willingness to engage in term funding activity. So the tenor of almost all activity in the market now is overnight. Third, there are growing liquidity strains at major financial institutions. Obviously, Wachovia is part of that story. Fourth, we’ve seen a significant rise in the demand for our TSLF and TAF credit.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: For example, the stop-out rate for the most recent TAF auction, which was a 28-day maturity auction, was 3.75 percent, significantly above the one-month LIBOR rate at the time. Fifth, we’ve seen a sharp rise in PCF and PDCF borrowings. For example, on the week ending last Wednesday, PCF credit was $39.4 billion, an increase of about $18 billion from the previous week, and PDCF borrowing was $88 billion in the latest week, up $68 billion from the previous week. Last, European banking strains have been increasingly evident in recent days, especially this weekend following the announcement of the Fortis rescue and the nationalization of B&B in the United Kingdom. The European banking news has led to a sharp drop in the European equity markets—this morning they’re down 2 to 3 percent—and the euro and sterling exchange rates have dropped quite sharply against the dollar, down about 2 percent.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: Now, along with this increase in authorized swap lines, Chairman Bernanke has approved the staff recommendation for a large increase in our term auction facility (TAF) program. We are proposing two changes in the TAF program. First, we’re proposing to increase the 84-day TAF auction sizes to $75 billion per auction, from $25 billion. That will start with the next 84-day auction that was scheduled for October 6.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: The second change is that the Chairman has approved two forward TAF auctions totaling $150 billion. These auctions would take place in November, and they would auction short-dated TAF funds for one-week or two-week terms over year-end.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: Together, these two changes to the TAF program would increase the supply of TAF credit to $450 billion, from $150 billion currently. The notion is that a larger commitment to TAF funding should help ameliorate market concerns about the availability of term funding and about the availability of such funding over year-end.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: The effective dates for the swap lines and all the programs will be extended, I think, to April 30, 2009. This would enable the foreign central banks to extend 84-day TAF credit through year-end under their swap agreements.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: Obviously, these commitments are likely to put considerable further strain on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. In recent days we have been offsetting the large reserve additions with the Treasury SFP (supplementary financing program) cash- management bill issuance. After this week’s scheduled bill issuance, the total amount of outstanding SFP obligations will reach $400 billion. However, we cannot rely on this program indefinitely because the Treasury’s room under the debt limit ceiling is about $900 billion as of early last week and is shrinking rapidly because of the SFP and other ongoing funding commitments.\n",
      "Paragraph 14: PARTICIPANT. It’s impossible to hear.\n",
      "Paragraph 15: MR. FISHER. Someone has had a BlackBerry on during the last two or three sentences.\n",
      "Paragraph 16: MS. DANKER. New York, in particular, could you make sure you have no cell phones or BlackBerrys near the microphones.\n",
      "Paragraph 17: MR. DUDLEY. I’ll make sure everything is off. Probably I’m the culprit. Poetic justice. Let me just repeat the last stuff on the SFP. After this week’s scheduled bill issuance, the total amount of SFP obligations will be $400 billion. We can’t keep relying on that program indefinitely, though, because the Treasury’s room under the debt limit ceiling, which was $900 billion as of early last week, is shrinking rapidly because of that program and other ongoing funding commitments. So that’s where the interest on reserves legislation comes in. Assuming that the Congress enacts that legislation this week, we will be able to pay interest on reserves. I’ll leave that to Brian to talk about in more detail. Thank you. I’m happy to take any questions.\n",
      "Paragraph 18: CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. So just to clarify, we’ll be asking you for the following two actions after the question-and-answer period. One is, again, that although the Foreign Currency Subcommittee was authorized to increase swaps, because we are essentially doubling the outstanding swap lines, we would like to go back to the Committee for a vote, or to hear your views, to get approval for those swap lines, which pending approval, we plan to announce shortly, right?\n",
      "Paragraph 19: MR. DUDLEY. At 10 a.m.\n",
      "Paragraph 20: CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes, very shortly. The other thing, which also requires a vote, is that, in order to do three-month swaps over year-end, some of the three-month swaps would go beyond January 30. So we’re asking for the extension not for all programs but only for the swap lines to April 30. Is that right?\n",
      "Paragraph 21: MR. DUDLEY. Yes.\n",
      "Paragraph 22: CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. So that’s the second request—to extend the swap line authorizations to April 30 of next year. With those two points in mind, are there any questions for Bill? President Plosser.\n",
      "Paragraph 23: MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was confused about April 30. I thought I heard Bill Dudley say that he’s requesting the TAF be extended to April 30. Is it just the swap lines, or is it both? Can I get some clarification?\n",
      "Paragraph 24: MR. DUDLEY. Just the swap lines. The TAF program doesn’t need an authorization because it is just within the discount window program.\n",
      "Paragraph 25: CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The issue of unusual and exigent is not coming up here because we’re not dealing with any section 13(3) lending today. President Evans.\n",
      "Paragraph 26: MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d just like to review by asking a question. The swap lines are very large now. Could we review what could go wrong for our balance sheet in a not-so-pleasant scenario? Are these actions consistent—and I think they are—with the substantial deleveraging of the financial system that we’re trying to make take place in an orderly fashion but we can’t resist the natural forces that have to take place? Thank you.\n",
      "Paragraph 27: MR. DUDLEY. I think that’s correct. Our strategy all along has been not to prevent the deleveraging or the unwinding that developed earlier but to stretch it out a little so fewer things break. The swap lines are just one more tool to help that process unfold without severe systemic consequences occurring. Obviously, things are breaking, even with all the tools that we’ve rolled out. So I think that just suggests that more force needs to be applied. Clearly, confidence in the markets is extraordinarily poor and fragile, and that’s another reason that an escalation in the authorizations is important—to reassure people that the central banks are prepared to be there, if necessary.\n",
      "Paragraph 28: CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Of course, for the balance sheet—and we’ll discuss that also with interest on reserves—it has the benefit of having zero credit risk because the other central banks are our counterparties. President Evans, did you have another comment?\n",
      "Paragraph 29: MR. EVANS. Well, I suppose you answered my question there. It just seems that, in looking at the TAF auctions, there are a number of foreign institutions that, because I don’t follow it, I’m not familiar with, and these are the types of institutions that are borrowing under these agreements. But I suppose that the foreign central banks are careful with their counterparties.\n",
      "Paragraph 30: CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Other questions for Bill? If there are no questions, since Bill has to go and get ready for the announcement—sorry, President Plosser.\n",
      "Paragraph 31: MR. PLOSSER. It’s not pertinent to this particular decision, but I was going to ask Bill whether there are any other sorts of measures or tools that the Desk in New York is considering— that are being explored or thought about going forward?\n",
      "Paragraph 32: MR. DUDLEY. We’re looking at a lot of different things to potentially make the management of reserves more effective and to provide more support for the market. But we don’t have anything that is close to being put forward at this time. We’re always looking at contingencies, what other tools are available, and what other options might be available, but there’s nothing that I would say is imminent.\n",
      "Paragraph 33: VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Mr. Chairman, could I just add one thing? Maybe Eric could speak to this. I think the only other thing at the moment that deserves some quick reflection is whether the Federal Reserve should be modifying the facilities it put in place for money market funds last week. A team of people across the System is looking at a range of options there and is likely to give a recommendation to the Chairman sometime later today. My own sense is that it is the only area in which there is an immediate, compelling need and there’s active exploration of some escalation options.\n",
      "Paragraph 34: CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. With the anticipated passage of the fiscal plan, a lot of our intellectual talents are going to be harnessed trying to support the Treasury in thinking about their auctions and other strategies that they’re going to use. The Board, New York, and others have been working very closely with the Treasury staff. Other questions? President Lacker, do you have a question?\n",
      "Paragraph 35: MR. LACKER. Yes. What do we know about the time line for the implementation of the Treasury’s program of insuring money market mutual funds and how that would work?\n",
      "Paragraph 36: CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. They have already put in place a program that insures deposits that were there before a fixed date. In other words, new deposits are not protected. They made that change because they were generating runs from banks into money market mutual funds and the banks were complaining.\n",
      "Paragraph 37: MR. LACKER. Now, Vice Chairman Geithner, does the recommendation likely to come forward involve expanding or contracting the coverage?\n",
      "Paragraph 38: VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. It is obviously not my decision, but they are looking at options that go in the direction of expanding the liquidity support provided both to the agent banks and perhaps directly to the funds themselves.\n",
      "Paragraph 39: MR. LACKER. But any change in the space of qualified commercial paper?\n",
      "Paragraph 40: VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Eric may be a little closer to this than I am at the moment. Again, they’re looking at it broadly, conceptually. The options fall into expanding the scope of the types of funds covered by the—what’s it called, Eric?—the AMLF.\n",
      "Paragraph 41: MR. ROSENGREN. That’s right.\n",
      "Paragraph 42: VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Second would be some expanded section 23A approvals to facilitate what the clearing banks need to do to provide liquidity. Another option would be to expand the scope of instruments that might be supported through that program. Another option might be to lend directly to money funds against a broader class of assets, and of course, it’s possible that the Treasury may rejigger, change, expand, or add to their guaranty.\n",
      "Paragraph 43: CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Other questions, comments? Let me ask: Scott, are you prepared to state the resolutions we would like? Brian? Anyone? I’d like to note for the record that all three of the staff briefers today—Bill, Brian, and Scott—worked all night last night. So we have dedicated employees here in the System. Brian.\n",
      "Paragraph 44: MR. MADIGAN. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I’ll read a resolution regarding the swap lines: “The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to take the following actions to amend the existing temporary swap arrangements with foreign central banks as follows: with the Bank of Canada, to increase the aggregate amount to $30 billion; with the Bank of England to increase the aggregate amount to $80 billion; with the Bank of Japan to increase the aggregate amount to $120 billion; with the Danish National Bank to increase the aggregate amount to $15 billion; with the European Central Bank to increase the aggregate amount to $240 billion; with the Norges Bank to increase the aggregate amount to $15 billion; with the Reserve Bank of Australia to increase the aggregate amount to $30 billion; with the Swedish Riksbank to increase the aggregate amount to $30 billion; with the Swiss National Bank to increase the aggregate amount to $60 billion. In each case the System Open Market Account Manager would be authorized to determine appropriate liquidity buffers. The FOMC also extends the current delegation of authority to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee until April 30, 2009.” MS. DANKER. And it extends the expiration dates.\n",
      "Paragraph 45: CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. He has that. Okay. So there’s a motion. Any further questions or comments? If there’s no objection, may I take a vote now? Debbie.\n",
      "Paragraph 46: MS. DANKER.\n",
      "Paragraph 47: Chairman Bernanke Yes Vice Chairman Geithner Yes Governor Duke Yes President Fisher Yes Governor Kohn Yes Governor Kroszner Yes President Pianalto Yes President Plosser Yes President Stern Yes Governor Warsh Yes CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you very much. I’m going to excuse Bill if he wants to go. There he goes. [Laughter] All right. Let me turn now to the second item, which is a briefing by Scott Alvarez, who as I said worked all night on the Wachovia situation. If President Lacker would like to add anything, he is certainly welcome to do so. Scott.\n",
      "Paragraph 48: MR. ALVAREZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On Friday, Wachovia experienced significant liquidity pressures, and its management concluded that it would have difficulty funding itself this week. So the board of directors of Wachovia authorized the management to begin entertaining merger offers. Wells Fargo and Citi quickly emerged as the leading candidates among a group of candidates, but by Sunday it became clear that those two, which were the only remaining candidates by Sunday, could accomplish the merger only with government assistance. For a variety of reasons, the Board believed that it was appropriate to implement the systemic risk exception to give the FDIC the widest flexibility to resolve Wachovia in order to maintain confidence in the banking system. Among the reasons was the concern about liquidity pressures that would be felt by similarly situated banking institutions if there was a disorderly or very focused failure of Wachovia. Also, there was concern that, because Wachovia looked so strong on a capital basis and it would be somewhat surprising to some in the market when it closed, it would send a bad signal about similarly situated institutions. There was also concern about the large amount of foreign deposits that would be left behind in a least-cost resolution; the potential for money market mutual funds, which are already in a fragile state, to have further disruption from a least-cost resolution; and that the current financial turmoil and weakened economy would be further weakened if the least- cost solution was pursued and that might undermine business and household confidence.\n",
      "Paragraph 49: The FDIC and the Treasury both agreed with that analysis, and the Secretary consulted with the President, and the systemic risk exception was invoked on Sunday late afternoon. After a bidding process that was run by the FDIC between Citi and Wells Fargo, Citi emerged as the better bid for Wachovia. You may have seen this morning a report about that bid. Citi offered slightly more than $2 billion to the existing shareholders. Plus it would buy out all of the banks from underneath Wachovia and leave A.G. Edwards and Evergreen, the two investment banking firms of Wachovia, with the existing shareholders. Citi identified a portfolio of largely real estate–related assets that was about $312 billion in size that it felt it could not handle without some loss-sharing with the FDIC. It proposed to the FDIC that Citi would take a $54 billion first loss position, and then it asked the FDIC to share losses—actually to take losses on the portfolio—above the $54 billion mark. The FDIC’s analysis of that was that the $54 billion cushion was sufficient to allow the FDIC on its average basis to emerge with little or no loss, and so the FDIC accepted that bid.\n",
      "Paragraph 50: The Board was asked to give some capital relief to Citi in connection with this and did agree to give relief at the holding company level from the tier 1 regulatory ratio and the leverage ratio for approximately $270 billion worth of assets that would come over from Wachovia to Citi. That capital relief will be amortized over time and is similar in many ways to the relief that was granted in the Bear Stearns transaction. An application will be filed shortly for the merger. The two parties are still working out the details of the merger agreement, but they expect to have it done in the next day or so. That’s all.\n",
      "Paragraph 51: CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Are there questions for Scott? President Lacker, would you like to add anything?\n",
      "Paragraph 52: MR. LACKER. Yes. Wachovia was losing about $1 billion in deposits a day on average over the past couple of weeks. They have liquidity to last under a calm scenario this week only until maybe Thursday or Friday. They probably would have needed discount window borrowing in the middle of the week; but given the news, they were affected by the WaMu closure because of what that did to senior debt holders, and they began experiencing companies pulling away from them in the middle of the day on Friday. So they were sort of caught up in the wake after WaMu. They didn’t think they could survive without a lot of support today. So they were very committed to doing something over the weekend. They have $64 billion plus in collateral, lendable value pledged at the discount window. They have $12.5 billion outstanding at the TAF, some of that 28-day, some of that in the two 84-day auctions, and we will leave them on primary credit, and they’ll retain that TAF credit. We intend issuing an announcement later this morning that says something like, “In support of this transition, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond stands ready to provide liquidity as needed.” So they have $52 billion in lendable value net of the TAF money. They have $150 billion in uninsured deposits, and as for other numbers, the market cap at the end of the day Friday was a little over $21 billion. Evergreen Investments, Wachovia Securities, and A.G. Edwards have a value of about $12 billion. This leaves shareholders of the holding company with about $14 billion in value.\n",

      "Paragraph 64: MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, this may be a conversation for another day, but it seems to me that we’re ending up with more and more concentration—Bank of America, Citicorp, Morgan— and I’m curious as to what we plan longer term so as not to displace the ability of other institutions to play their role in the financial markets and grow their businesses—the super-regionals that are healthy and so on. But I guess just philosophically what concerns me longer term is that, in response to these actions, there are no other people to take these steps, but we’re creating larger and larger concentrations and bigger and bigger situations where we have too big to fail. I’d just like at some point to have a conversation on that matter. I’m not objecting to the move taken, obviously, but it is going to present a bigger problem as we go down the path because we’re getting increasing concentration in fewer and fewer institutions. Just a comment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n",
      "Paragraph 65: CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, let me just add that I share your concern. There is an increasing concentration. On the other hand, you could also view it as part of a process of consolidation as well, as we have reduced the number of independent investment banks, for example. But I agree with that. We have been very constrained throughout this entire crisis, as you know, by the existing facilities for dealing with failing institutions and mergers being one of the only tools we have. Going forward, I think there is some hope in the near term under the new TARP, which would allow resolutions using capital injections basically without necessarily doing a merger. Then subsequently, I think it’s very important, as we look toward restructuring our financial regulatory system, to develop good resolution mechanisms and to think about the issues of concentration and too big to fail. So I take your point, basically.\n",
      "Paragraph 66: MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n",
      "Paragraph 67: CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Any other questions for Scott or for Jeff? All right. If not, let me turn to our last item on the agenda, which is interest on reserves. The TARP legislation provides for that, and Brian will talk a bit about how we might use that.\n",
      "Paragraph 68: MR. MADIGAN. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. As the Chairman indicated, the TARP legislation includes a provision that accelerates the effective date of the authority to pay interest on reserves from October 1, 2011, to October 1, 2008. The Federal Reserve staff believes that we’re ready to start paying interest on reserve balances beginning with the reserve maintenance period that starts on October 9. Assuming that the legislation is passed by the Congress and signed by the President later this week, we plan to recommend shortly thereafter to the Board that the Board direct the Reserve Banks to begin paying interest on reserves on October 9. Specifically, we plan to suggest that required reserve balances be remunerated at a rate of the target federal funds rate less 10 basis points, and more significantly in current circumstances, that excess reserve balances be remunerated initially at a rate of the target federal funds rate less 50 basis points. We anticipate that the spread between the excess reserves rate and the target federal funds rate may well need to be adjusted over time, but we’re suggesting a 50 basis point spread initially. We’re proposing no other significant changes to the reserve maintenance framework at this time, although we’ll be recommending a few relatively technical changes that are motivated by the ability to pay interest on reserves.\n",
      "Paragraph 69: In more normal circumstances, we’d think of the system that we’re recommending at this time as being a type of a corridor system but with required reserves. The primary credit rate should set the ceiling for the federal funds rate; the excess reserves rate should set the floor.\n",
      "Paragraph 70: In the current circumstances, though, it may turn out that the system will operate more like what we have been calling a floor system in which the gap between the target federal funds rate and the excess reserves rate is narrow. This is because, as was discussed earlier, our tools to absorb reserves provided by, again, various lending operations could be constrained given the limited remaining capacity to sell securities and possibly reluctance on the part of Treasury to expand further the supplementary financing program. In any case, the interest rate on excess reserves should put a floor— possibly a soft floor, but a floor—under the funds rate and thereby allow the Federal Reserve to conduct monetary policy appropriately while providing liquidity consistent with financial stability. I would note that the overall reserve maintenance framework will remain very complex, possibly overly complex. The staff plans to continue the study that we presented to the Reserve Bank presidents and the Board members earlier this year, and at some point, we expect to bring significant further changes to the policymakers for consideration. But for now, we think that the changes that we’re proposing will make effective use of the authority that we expect we’ll have beginning on October 1. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.\n",
      "Paragraph 71: CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thanks, Brian. Are there questions for Brian? President Lacker.\n",
      "Paragraph 72: MR. LACKER. Yes, Brian. So at 50 basis points under the target rate for excess, it sounds as though your philosophy here is just to limit the tails of the intraday funds rate distribution rather than to attract a lot of funds and replace the Treasury program. Is that accurate? I mean, how do you intend to approach that question?\n",
      "Paragraph 73: MR. MADIGAN. President Lacker, I think we’re going to need to proceed somewhat adaptively. We’ll be going from one type of system, in which there has been no remuneration on excess reserves, to one with a rate that’s fairly close to—50 basis points under—the federal funds rate. My guess is that it could attract a substantial increase in banks’ interest in holding excess reserves, especially under current circumstances, when there’s a lot of concern about counterparty credit risk. It may well be the case, as I mentioned, that we’ll be proposing a further narrowing of the excess reserves rate as we get experience, and we may, indeed, have to do that if our ability to drain reserves is otherwise constrained. We may need to use the excess reserves rate as the way to effectively set the federal funds rate. But I think we’ll need to see how it goes and get some experience.\n",
      "Paragraph 74: CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Other questions for Brian? Jeff, did you have another question? No. Okay. Any other comments or issues? If not, thank you very much, again, for the short notice, and we’ll obviously keep you well briefed, and we hope you’ll do the same for us.\n",

      "Paragraph: MR. ALVAREZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On Friday, Wachovia experienced significant liquidity pressures, and its management concluded that it would have difficulty funding itself this week. So the board of directors of Wachovia authorized the management to begin entertaining merger offers.

For a variety of reasons, the Board believed that it was appropriate to implement the systemic risk exception to give the FDIC the widest flexibility to resolve Wachovia in order to maintain confidence in the banking system. Among the reasons was the concern about liquidity pressures that would be felt by similarly situated banking institutions if there was a disorderly or very focused failure of Wachovia. Also, there was concern that, because Wachovia looked so strong on a capital basis and it would be somewhat surprising to some in the market when it closed, it would send a bad signal about similarly situated institutions. There was also concern about the large amount of foreign deposits that would be left behind in a least-cost resolution; the potential for money market mutual funds, which are already in a fragile state, to have further disruption from a least-cost resolution; and that the current financial turmoil and weakened economy would be further weakened if the least- cost solution was pursued and that might undermine business and household confidence.\n",

We have been very constrained throughout this entire crisis, as you know, by the existing facilities for dealing with failing institutions and mergers being one of the only tools we have. Going forward, I think there is some hope in the near term under the new TARP, which would allow resolutions using capital injections basically without necessarily doing a merger.

    "Your key paragraphs here:\n",
    "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I have three topics to raise with you today. First, financial market conditions, as you know, remain quite strained, and in response to that we are proposing some additional liquidity measures. Mostly this is informational. However, we are proposing to increase the swap lines fairly significantly, and although you have authorized the Foreign Currency Subcommittee to take those actions, we thought that, given the size of the change, it would be worthwhile to bring this back to you for your attention and your vote just to get the Committee’s agreement on this issue. The second issue is Wachovia. As you may have heard, Wachovia was purchased, or there’s a plan to purchase, by Citigroup this morning. To facilitate that purchase, the Board invoked the systemic risk exception, which has not been done before. So we want to give you a chance to catch up on what’s going on there. Then third, we want to talk a bit about interest on reserves, which will be provided in the Paulson financial rescue bill, which is supposed to be up for a vote on Wednesday. I just want to brief you on what we’re planning in that regard. So let me start by turning to Bill Dudley in New York. Bill, if you could give us a brief overview of the financial conditions that motivate these actions, review the actions we’re proposing, and take Q&A, that would be very helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The staff believes that these large increases are appropriate to reassure market participants that the world’s central banks are prepared to take extraordinary steps as needed to address ongoing strains in financial markets. These strains are evident in a number of ways. First, we’ve seen a sharp rise in overnight dollar funding rates and in term LIBOR–OIS spreads. For example, on Friday, the three-month LIBOR–OIS spread was over 200 basis points, and in fact, LIBOR may actually understate the degree of funding pressure. The NYFR index, which is the U.S.-based alternative to LIBOR, has actually been much higher than LIBOR over the past week or two. So LIBOR actually may be understated. Second, there have been many anecdotal reports of a withdrawal of counterparties’ willingness to engage in term funding activity. So the tenor of almost all activity in the market now is overnight. Third, there are growing liquidity strains at major financial institutions. Obviously, Wachovia is part of that story. Fourth, we’ve seen a significant rise in the demand for our TSLF and TAF credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the stop-out rate for the most recent TAF auction, which was a 28-day maturity auction, was 3.75 percent, significantly above the one-month LIBOR rate at the time. Fifth, we’ve seen a sharp rise in PCF and PDCF borrowings. For example, on the week ending last Wednesday, PCF credit was $39.4 billion, an increase of about $18 billion from the previous week, and PDCF borrowing was $88 billion in the latest week, up $68 billion from the previous week. Last, European banking strains have been increasingly evident in recent days, especially this weekend following the announcement of the Fortis rescue and the nationalization of B&B in the United Kingdom. The European banking news has led to a sharp drop in the European equity markets—this morning they’re down 2 to 3 percent—and the euro and sterling exchange rates have dropped quite sharply against the dollar, down about 2 percent.\n",
